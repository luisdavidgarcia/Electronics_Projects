<h3>Motivation for the Project</h3>

In a Circuits 1 assignment, I got the opportunity to create a continuity tester, which would serve as the model for the continuity tester we design on Eagle and test using LTspice. I faced immense difficulty building this continuity tester due to it being my first time reading a data sheet for a component, but learning how to read a data served me well in my future projects and assignments since now I know where to make the appropriate connections with wires to get my desired output. 

Here specifically what required reading of a data sheet was the Texas Instruments LM358 op-amp since I had to identify the inverting and non inverting input for the continuity tester to work properly. The circuit I built here was also my first time working with an Arduino since prior I have only worked with Raspberry Pi, but it was simple to get adjusted since the programming involved is highly similar to C++.

<h3>Motivation for the Project</h3>

I created an ohmmeter that measures the resistance of a resistor by pressing a button since the button initiates the program to start reading the resistor by supplying current to flow through the resistor I will measure. Using a voltage divider equation I can just attain the voltage of resistor, that is then used to calculate the resistance by using Ohmâ€™s law R = V/I, in which R is the resistance, V is the voltage of the resistor, and I is the current flowing through the resistor. I wrote the code for this program completely in Arduino and utilized only the analog pins to then convert them to digital values as part of the solution for the resistance.
